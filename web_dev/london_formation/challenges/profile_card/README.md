Goal: Create a responsive profile card.

	1.	HTML:
	•	Create a simple card layout with an image (profile picture), name, and a brief bio.
	•	Add social media links using icons (you can use Font Awesome or similar).
	2.	CSS:
	•	Style the card to have a shadow, rounded corners, and center the image.
	•	Customize hover effects for the social media icons.
	3.	Bootstrap:
	•	Make the card responsive using Bootstrap’s grid system (col-sm-6, col-md-4 etc.).
	•	Add a button to “Follow” using Bootstrap’s btn classes.

Bonus:

	•	Add a hover effect to zoom the profile picture slightly.
	•	Make the layout adjust to smaller screens with Bootstrap’s grid.
