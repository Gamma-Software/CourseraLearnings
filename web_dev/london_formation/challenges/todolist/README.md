Challenge 4: To-Do List (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Goal: Build a functional to-do list app with the ability to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

	1.	HTML:
	•	Create a simple layout with an input field to add tasks and a list to display them.
	2.	CSS:
	•	Style the to-do list (center the input field, use padding, margins, etc.).
	•	Style completed tasks with a strikethrough effect.
	3.	JavaScript:
	•	Implement functionality to:
	•	Add tasks to the list.
	•	Mark tasks as completed.
	•	Delete tasks from the list.

Bonus:

	•	Use localStorage to save tasks so that they persist after refreshing the page.
	•	Add a priority indicator (low, medium, high) for each task and color-code the tasks accordingly.
